The dataset used for this assigment is Hotel Booking Demand from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand/version/1)

### Data exploration findings: 

According to Kaggle discussion forum for this dataset about booking made in Portugal.\
The data consisted of 119390 records with 32 features recorded per each record. \
To get more insights about the data I checked types of data in the columns as well as the number of unique values. 

After the analysis of missing values I dropped 2 columns with most missing values and also dropped 'Country' columns
